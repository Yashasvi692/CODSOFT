This repository contains three Python scripts developed during my internship at Codsoft:

1. Calculator (task2.py): A simple command-line calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations such as
   addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. The user inputs two numbers and an operation symbol, and the script returns the result.
   
2. Password Generator (task3.py): A script that generates a secure password based on the desired length.
   It combines lowercase, uppercase, digits, and special characters to create a random password.

3. Rock, Paper, Scissors Game (task4.py): An interactive command-line game where the user plays rock, paper, scissors against the computer.
   The game keeps track of scores and allows users to play multiple rounds.
